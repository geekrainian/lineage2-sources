This release and all of the former development after the CVS versions were held at http://opensvn.csie.org/l2j with a different revision numbering.

I'm uploading this source code and repository information for the history record of the project.

We moved from OpenSVN to our own SVN servers during the early C4 support stages, because our traffic were just too much.

If you're interested in the ancient pre-C3 support source code you can find it at OpenSVN while they still hold it. Additionally there's some pre C3 binaries published in our sourceforge.net files page.
